# TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: ~15 hours

Completed:

* [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Optional: UI animations
* [x] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

Notes:

* This code is rudimentary and could use a lot of refactoring, cleanup, and abstraction.
* The blur popover effect can be achieved in earlier versions of iOS, but for the purposes of this exercise, this app targets iOS 8+.
* Nearly all UI elements are added and manipulated programmatically. The only IB elements added via storyboard are the rating labels.
* There are no image assets in this app; everything (incuding the slider button) is drawn programmatically using CoreGraphics.
